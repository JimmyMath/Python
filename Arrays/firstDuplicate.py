#Note: Write a solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) additional space complexity, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

#Given an array a that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers, return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.

#Example

#For a = [2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 2], the output should be
#firstDuplicate(a) = 3.

#There are 2 duplicates: numbers 2 and 3. The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than than second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.

#For a = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1], the output should be
#firstDuplicate(a) = -1.
 
#Input/Output

#[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py)

#[input] array.integer a

#Guaranteed constraints:
#1 ≤ a.length ≤ 10**5,
#1 ≤ a[i] ≤ a.length.

#[output] integer

#The element in a that occurs in the array more than once and has the minimal index for its second occurrence. If there are no such elements, return -1.
